# Service Status Dashboard (React + TypeScript)

This repository contains a small training project built to practice modern
front-end development with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, **ESLint**, and **Prettier**.

The goal of this project is not to build a production-ready application,  
but to simulate a **realistic technical exercise** similar to those used in
high-level engineering interviews (e.g., Canonical-style assessments).

---

## 🚀 Purpose of the Project

This project was created as a structured environment to:

- Practice clean React architecture using components, hooks and TypeScript.
- Simulate real-world requirements such as:
  - data fetching (mocked),
  - filtering,
  - sorting,
  - search,
  - error and loading states,
  - accessibility considerations.
- Improve React problem-solving and state management skills.
- Develop consistent coding habits through:
  - strict ESLint rules,
  - automatic formatting via Prettier,
  - proper project structure with Vite.

It serves as a **personal learning dojo** to sharpen front-end technical skills and prepare for advanced technical assessments.
